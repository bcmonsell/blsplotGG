SEATS seasonal adjustment run.}
\usage{
plot_time_shift(
  seas_obj = NULL,
  main_title = NULL,
  sub_title = NULL,
  this_y_label = "Time Shift",
  this_x_label = "Cycles per Year",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{seas_obj}{\code{seas} object generated from a call of \code{seas} on a single time series
This is a required entry.}

\item{main_title}{Character string; main title of plot.
A title will be generated if no title is specified.}

\item{sub_title}{Character string; subtitle of plot. There is no default subtitle.}

\item{this_y_label}{Character string; y-axis label for plot.
Default is \code{"Time Shift"}.}

\item{this_x_label}{Label for X axis. Default is \code{"Cycles per Year"}.}

\item{do_grid}{Logical scalar; indicates if certain plots will have grid lines.
Default is no grid lines.}

\item{do_background}{Logical scalar; indicates grey background included in plot.
Default is no grey background;}

\item{line_color}{Character vector of length two; colors used for the squared gain #'        in the plot.
Default is \code{NULL}, which indicates that the palette specified
in \code{this_palette} is used to generate colors for this plot.}

\item{this_palette}{Color used for lines in plot. Default is \code{"Paired"}}

\item{this_guide_legend}{Title for legend.  Default is \code{"Filter"}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object which generates a plot of the squared gains for filters
generated by the SEATS seasonal factors.
If SEATS seaonal adjustment (with \code{finite = yes}) not producted,
print out error message and return NULL.
}
\description{
Generate squared gains plot of the concurrent and symmetric SEATS seasonal adjustment
and trend filters from a SEATS adjustment from a \code{seas} object generated by the \code{seasonal}
package.
