Description: Generates several types of time series plots useful for seasonal adjustment analysis using ggplot2.
    These routines rely heavily on the seasonal package to extract series and components from the '
    seasonal adjustments generated by the US Census Bureau's X-13ARIMA-SEATS software, and can be
    generated from a single seas object or a list of seas objects. Types of plots include line 
    plots, ratio plots, forecast plots, forecast error diagnostic plots, spectral plots, seasonal
    factor plots, seasonal adjustment component plots, revisions history diagnostic plots, and SEATS diagnostic plots. 
	Users can add grid lines, remove background shading, and shade recession
    regions in selected plots.
